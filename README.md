## Team Dynamic and Git Workflow

We met briefly on Thursday afternoon to confirm that we wanted to work on the Survey Gorilla project instead of designing our own, and again Friday morning to designate roles. Alan and Rootul were responsible for designing the models, Avi and John came up with the original structure for our controllers, Anthony wrote the code that allows users to take surveys and did most of the design, and Molly wrote the survey creation code. Rootul added the result charts, and John was our merge master (with help from Avi).

We used a combination of Trello and GitHub to keep track of who was working on which tasks, as well as email to be sure that everyone had pulled the most recently pushed changes.
